# You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.


# Find the maximum profit you can achieve. 
# You may complete as many transactions as you like 
# (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times)
#  with the following restrictions:

# After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).
# Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).


# Example 1:
# Input: prices = [1,2,3,0,2]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
# Example 2:

# Input: prices = [1]
# Output: 0
