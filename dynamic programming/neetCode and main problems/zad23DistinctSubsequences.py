# Given two strings s and t, return the number of distinct subsequences of s which equals t.

# A string's subsequence is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some 
# (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the remaining characters' relative positions. 
# (i.e., "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

# The test cases are generated so that the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "rabbbit", t = "rabbit"
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
# rabbbit
# rabbbit
# rabbbit
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "babgbag", t = "bag"
# Output: 5
# there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
